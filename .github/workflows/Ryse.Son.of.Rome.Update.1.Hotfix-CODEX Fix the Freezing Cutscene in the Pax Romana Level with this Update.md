The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its graphics, combat system, and voice acting, but criticized its repetitive gameplay, linear level design, and lack of replay value. The PC version was also criticized for its high system requirements and technical issues.

The gameplay of Ryse: Son of Rome has been praised for its realistic and immersive graphics, fluid and responsive combat system, and impressive voice acting. The game uses the CryEngine 3, which delivers stunning visuals and realistic physics. The combat system allows the player to switch between different weapons and stances, block and dodge attacks, and perform combos and executions. The voice acting features actors such as John Hopkins, Richard Madden, and Patrick Stewart, who bring the characters to life.
 
However, the gameplay of Ryse: Son of Rome has also been criticized for its repetitive and shallow gameplay, linear and scripted level design, and lack of replay value. The game has been accused of being too easy and relying too much on quick time events, which reduce the challenge and variety of the combat. The game has also been criticized for having a short and predictable story, which does not offer much choice or consequence to the player. The game has also been criticized for having a limited multiplayer mode, which does not offer much customization or progression.
 
Overall, Ryse: Son of Rome update 1 hotfix-CODEX did not improve or worsen the gameplay of Ryse: Son of Rome, which remained a mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses. The gameplay of Ryse: Son of Rome is a matter of personal preference, as some players may enjoy its cinematic and visceral action-adventure experience, while others may find it boring and shallow.
