Android is a popular mobile operating system based on the Linux kernel and developed by Google. But did you know that you can also run Android on your PC using a virtual machine? In this article, we will show you how to download and run Android on VMware, a powerful virtualization software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single host.
 
Running Android on VMware has many benefits, such as testing apps, playing games, accessing Google services, and customizing the system. You can also use Android as a secondary operating system without affecting your primary one. To run Android on VMware, you will need two things: an Android ISO image file and a VMware virtual machine.

## Step 1: Download an Android ISO Image File
 
An Android ISO image file is a file that contains the installation files of the Android operating system. You can download an Android ISO image file from various sources, such as the official Android-x86 project website or third-party websites like OSBoxes or TechRechard. These websites offer different versions of Android, such as LineageOS, Pie, Oreo, etc., for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. You can choose the one that suits your needs and preferences.
 
For example, if you want to download the latest version of Android-x86 9.0-R2 Pie for 64-bit systems, you can go to [OSBoxes](https://www.osboxes.org/android-x86/) [^1^] and click on the "VirtualBox (VDI) 64bit Download" button under the "Android-x86 9.0-R2 Pie" section. This will download a ZIP file containing the VDI file, which is a virtual disk image file for VirtualBox. You can also download the VMDK file, which is a virtual disk image file for VMware, by clicking on the "VMware (VMDK) 64bit Download" button.
 
## Step 2: Create a VMware Virtual Machine
 
Once you have downloaded the Android ISO image file, you need to create a VMware virtual machine to run it. You can use any VMware product, such as VMware Workstation, VMware Player, or VMware ESXi. In this article, we will use VMware Workstation as an example.
 
To create a VMware virtual machine for Android, follow these steps:
 
1. Open VMware Workstation and click on "File" > "New Virtual Machine".
2. Select "Custom (advanced)" and click "Next".
3. Select "Workstation 16.x" and click "Next".
4. Select "I will install the operating system later" and click "Next".
5. Select "Linux" as the guest operating system and "Other Linux 5.x or later kernel 64-bit" as the version. Click "Next".
6. Enter a name and location for the virtual machine and click "Next".
7. Select the number of processors and cores you want to assign to the virtual machine and click "Next".
8. Select the amount of memory you want to allocate to the virtual machine and click "Next".
9. Select "Use an existing virtual disk" and click "Next".
10. Browse to the location where you saved the VMDK file from OSBoxes or TechRechard and select it. Click "Finish".
11. Click on "Edit virtual machine settings" and go to the "CD/DVD (SATA)" tab.
12. Select "Use ISO image file" and browse to the location where you saved the ISO image file from OSBoxes or TechRechard. Click "OK".

## Step 3: Run Android on VMware
 
Now you are ready to run Android on VMware. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Power on the virtual machine and wait for it to boot from the ISO image file.
2. Select "Installation - Install Android-x86 to harddisk" from the boot menu.
3. Select "Create/Modify partitions" from the installation menu.
4. Select "No" when asked if you want to use 8cf37b1e13
